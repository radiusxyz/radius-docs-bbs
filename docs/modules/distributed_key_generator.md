# Distributed Key Generator
Distributed Key Generator is an implementation of aggregated encryption/decryption mechanism which generates both keys at a regular interval. At each interval, an encryption key and its ID pair is generated and made accessible to other entities such as Secure RPC. A decryption key is generated only after a certain amount of time and can be accessed using the corresponding encryption key ID.
