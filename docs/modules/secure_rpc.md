# Secure RPC
Secure RPC is a layer between wallet interface and sequencer that can receive unencrypted user transactions, encrypt them and forward them to sequencers belonging to a particular cluster. Except for encryption functionality, it works just like a proxy between users and sequencers. Secure RPC exists solely because the wallet interface does not support Radius encryption methods (PVDE and SKDE) and will be removed if the wallet supports a plugin or add-on features (e.g. MetaMask Snaps) and allows third-party modules.
