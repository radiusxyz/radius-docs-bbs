# Community Guidelines
Welcome to Radius community. We encourage everyone to engage in productive discussions and contributions. In order to do that, we adhere to the following code of conduct:

1. Please be kind, respectful and considerate to other community members. We all have different skill level, experience and cultural background. 
 
2. Avoid using discriminatory language. This includes racial slurs, derogatory or hateful comments towards an individual or group based on their characteristics: age, ethnicity, gender, race, religion and any characteristics which may define or allude to a certain group of people.
 
3. A conflict or disagreement is not always bad and is often a source of creativity. However, it is not okay to be disrespectful. We are solution seekers, not enemies.

In addition, all Rust projects of Radius adhere to the [Rust Code of Conduct](https://www.rust-lang.org/policies/code-of-conduct).

Any violation of the code of conduct can be reported to our maintainer at [kanet@theradius.xyz](mailto:kanet@theradius.xyz).
